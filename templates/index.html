        <br />
        
    
        <p style="text-align: center"> Each stage of meditation has its own distinct characteristics, challenges to overcome, and specific techniques for working through those challenges. The Stages mark gradual improvements in your abilities.
        
        <p style="text-align: center">
            There are also Four Milestone Achievements that divide the Ten Stages of meditation into four distinct parts. These are significant transition points that take your meditation to a whole new level.</p>

        <dt style="text-align: center"><img src="img/sahasrara1b.jpeg" alt="<3">Stage 10  </dt>
        <dd>The mind of the meditator at this 10th stage of development is also
known as the ‘unsurpassable’ or ‘unexcelled’ mind. <br />Because the
state of powerful concentration, fully conscious awareness, joyfulness,
tranquility and equanimity has not completely disappeared between
sessions, the meditator regains the fully developed meditative state
<br />immediately upon sitting down to practice again. <br />There is no need to
go through any intermediate stages. Because all of these factors are
present between meditation sessions, the meditator is capable of
practicing the Four Applications of Mindfulness in daily life with
amazing effectiveness.

        <br />
        
        <dt style="text-align: center"><img src="img/ajna2b.jpeg" alt="<3">Stage 8 to 9 (Milestone 4)  </dt>
        <dd>Stability of attention and mindful awareness are fully
developed, accompanied by meditative joy, tranquility and
equanimity, qualities which persist between meditation
sessions. This is the Concentration of an Adept. 
        </dd>
        
        <br />
        
        <dt style="text-align: center"><img src="img/vissudha3b.jpg" alt="&lt;3">Stage 7 (Milestone 3)  </dt>
        <dd>Effortless stability of the attention, also known as mental
pliancy, the compliant mind. The achievement of effortlessly sustained single-pointed
attention marks the first stage of development of the
Concentration of an Adept</dd>
         <br />        
        
        <dt style="text-align: center"><img src="img/anahata4b.jpg" alt="<3">Stages 5 to 6 (Milestone 2) </dt>
        <dd>Sustained single-pointed attention to the meditation object,
with exclusive focus. Sustained single-pointed attention constitutes the mastery of
Skilled Concentration.</dd>
        
        <br />        
        
        <dt style="text-align: center"><img src="img/muladhara5b.jpg" alt="<3">Stage 3 to 4 (Milestone 1) </dt>
        <dd>Uninterrupted continuity of attention to the meditation
object. This marks the first stage of
development of Skilled Concentration. The meditator is no longer
a novice, prone to mind-wandering and falling asleep.</dd>
         <br />       
        
        <dt style="text-align: center"><img src="img/svadisthana6b.jpg" alt="<3">Stage 2  </dt>
        <dd>When, in the duration of a one-hour sit, it can consistently be said that
the amount of time the attention has been focused on the meditation
object is noticeably longer than the time that it has been forgotten,
and when the typical period of sustained attention lasts minutes while
the periods of mind-wandering last only seconds, then the meditator
has mastered the second stage and has entered the third stage. </dd>
         
        <br />       
        
        <dt style="text-align: center"><img src="img/manipura7b.jpg" alt="<3">Stage 1 (New meditator)  </dt>
        <dd>This stage is characterized by a difficulty in achieving consistency and
regularity in sitting, and by meditation time often being spent doing
something other than the practice – daydreaming, problem solving,
etc.</dd>
